Hello,
My name is Timothy Sung. I graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I was born to Korean-American parents and raised in Voorhees, New Jersey. I moved to Michigan around 2015. My hobbies include drawing and playing games. A fun fact is that I am currently working on a web comic in my spare time.
